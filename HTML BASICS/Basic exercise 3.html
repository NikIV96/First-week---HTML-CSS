        <p>
          We're leaving together,<br>
          But still it's farewell<br>
          And maybe we'll come back,<br>
          To earth, who can tell?<br>
          I guess there is no one to blame,<br>
          We're leaving ground (leaving ground)<br>
          Will things ever be the same again?
        </p>

        <p>
          It's the final countdown.<br>
          The final countdown.
